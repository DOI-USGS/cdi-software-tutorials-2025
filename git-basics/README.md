# Git Basics

Introductory tutorial on Git basics.

## Pre-tutorial Instructions

This tutorial will use Git and Bash. You can use a basic terminal and a text editor or an editor
with an integrated terminal like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

> Make sure you switch to bash in whatever terminal you use with the command `bash` (e.g. default
> shell on macOS is now zsh)

See the following instructions to ensure the necessary software is installed on your computer:
[Prerequisite documentation](./prereq.md)

Following completion of the [prerequisite instructions](./prereq.md) verify that git is available
with the command `git --version`. If you have trouble with the installation, come to office hours
on 6/10/2025 for help.
