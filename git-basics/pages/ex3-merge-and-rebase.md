# Exercise 3: merge and rebase

TODO

1. merge branch A into main (this is local, normally you'd pull from upstream into main after a merge/pull request on remote)
    1. git merge -p ?
2. rebase branch B from main
    1. merge conflict
        1. what does it look like in terminal, editor, gui, etc. from different presenters
3. git log to show the history
4. git blame
